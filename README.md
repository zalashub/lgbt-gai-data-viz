# How accepting is your country of the LGBTQIA+ community?

*A data visualisation of the LGBT global acceptance index (GAI) in 174 countries around the world.*

The aim of the project was to present and compare how accepting are certain countries of the LGBTQIA+ community, exploring the patterns in separate continents.

***Global Acceptance Index** is a measure of the relative level of social acceptance of LGBT+ people and rights in each country.* 

Grouped by continent, the GAI of 174 countries as recorded in the year 2017 is visualised. 
The data was retrieved from a **report of the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law**. The visualisation was made with the **D3.js** library.
